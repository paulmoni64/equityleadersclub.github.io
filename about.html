                <p><h1><u><b>EQUITY LEADERS PROGRAM-DeKUT CHAPTER</u></u></h1></p>
                    <p>Equity Leaders’ Program is a club that brings together students that have been beneficiaries of<br> Equity Bank either as EALPs (Equity African Leaders Program) or WTF (Wings to Fly) alumni. <br>The EALP members are those that earned an internship to work in the bank branches situated in <br>various distinct parts of the country immediately after finishing their O levels. WTF alumni<br> members, who can also be members of EALP so long as they got to work in the bank branches, <br>are members that got sponsored by Equity Bank through Equity Group Foundation in their <br>secondary schooling but unfortunately failed to earn internships to work with the bank.</p>
                    <p>ELP, or rather ELC as it is famously referred to, has members in all universities in the country and<br>  each university identified as a chapter. For instance, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology is<br>  called DeKUT Chapter. Members in these chapters are basically students pursuing their respective <br> courses at the universities they are in.</p>
                    <p>ELP-DeKUT chapter boasts of 112 active members some of which are EALP members and others <br> WTF alumni. To ensure excellent cohesiveness and maximum self-development, this chapter is<br>  involved in activities that not only allows its members to bond like a family but only grow and<br>  develop to be dependable leaders at a personal level. Our activities range from community<br>  involvement such as visiting Children’s homes and empathizing with the children as a way of <br> giving back to the immediate society to academic mentorship to WTF scholars in secondary <br> schools within the Central Region. The chapter also organizes professional training annually so as <br> to train its members and equip them with requisite skills in job seeking and portraying themselves<br>  as potential employees.</p>
                    <p>The chapter is being led by elected leaders whom the members are so much proud of. The leaders <br> provide the zeal and zest that keeps the progress of the chapter afloat and are actually the <br> brainchildren of most of the activities undertaken by the chapter. In accordance with the <br> constitution of ELC, DeKUT chapter is governed by 5 leaders and Year Representatives. They <br> include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Chapter Leader<br></li>
                        <li>Deputy Chapter Leader<br></li>
                        <li>Organizing Secretary<br></li>
                        <li>Treasurer<br></li>
                        <li>Mentorship Coordinator<br></li>
                        <li>Year Representatives (Year 1,2,3 and 4)<br></li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>This chapter cherishes and respects the positive values, beliefs and cultural practices that its <br> members are involved in and is, at any given time, not discriminatory against anyone on the<br>  mentioned subjects. We dearly respect our diversity as members since it is our strength. <br>  Furthermore, we share common virtues as which include the following: teamwork, commitment, <br>  integrity, hard work among others. We all live to see the fulfillment of the chapter’s <br> objectives to an epic degree!</p>
